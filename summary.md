# Summary

Summary:

The conversation revolves around the potential of using waste heat from data centers to power district heating systems. The key points discussed are:

- Data centers generate a significant amount of waste heat as a byproduct of their operations, which is typically released into the environment.
- This waste heat can be captured and utilized to provide heating for buildings and homes through district heating networks.
- A project in Tallaght, Dublin, is leveraging the waste heat from an Amazon Web Services data center to power a district heating system. 
- The data center's low-temperature waste heat (around 25°C) is boosted using large-scale heat pumps and electric boilers to reach the required temperatures (70-80°C) for heating buildings.
- This approach eliminates the need for on-site fossil fuel combustion and associated infrastructure like boilers and flues in the connected buildings.
- District heating offers advantages for both consumers (no boilers, no safety risks, constant hot water/heating) and developers (no need to invest in renewables, space savings).
- The project has generated interest from developers in the area, who are eager to connect their buildings to the district heating network.

Key action items and follow-ups:

- Expand the district heating network by connecting more buildings and developments in the area
- Assess the potential for replicating this approach in other locations with data centers
- Promote the benefits of district heating to consumers and developers
- Address any technical or regulatory challenges in implementing district heating systems powered by waste heat

spk_0: So for context, the waste heat from a data center because a data center in reality, like it converts electricity to heat and through the process. And yeah, but the bits and bytes aren't reducing its efficiency. It's heat efficiency. It's that rather than it just being a bar heater in the process of producing the heat, it happens to do all of this computation and storage, etcetera. Um And we are, you know, everyone is very aware of the number of data centers we currently have in Ireland, the strain that they're putting on the electricity system and, and you know that there's a desire to bring more on in some regards, certainly a desire from the data center industry to join. But you know, it would be great if you could talk us through this, this because it means that they can actually be a key contributor to uh to our heating.

spk_1: Yeah, I mean, they're one of the kind of biggest waste sources that we have at the moment, particularly in Dublin. So I suppose it's a good match and usually kind of industries and that will be kind of located far away from, you know, you don't want your waste incinerator beside your cities normally. And we were looking to get the one that we did in Dublin City Center in that location. But um usually they're put far away and I suppose data centers all follow. Um I think it's called the T 50. I think it's the name of the kind of the fiber network around the Dublin region. So they're all very close, obviously, heat demand. So it, it's the location of the obviously the heat supply and the heat demand together. And what we did in Tallow was, you know, there was a new phase being built of an Amazon web services center in the middle of in the middle of tall on the top of Bell Garde Road, we had already been looking at the technical feasibility of district heating in that area because um South Dublin County Council buildings, we had the Tallaght Hospital, we had um TUD campus there. And I suppose those kind of key public sector buildings are kind of what we would call anchor loads for a for a network. So they're the kind of ones you tap into first, you get them on board and you can kind of connect everything in between them and start to grow the network off the back of those. So um the data center then I suppose had a planning requirements that you know, the waste heat will be provided to a network. And when it was built, the data center then gives off about 25 degree waste heat. And obviously the buildings existing buildings anyway, that we we're retrofitting for district heating require, you know, 7080 degrees. So we boost that then through. So the energy center is being built and in there that's going to have large scale heat pumps. Um So three megawatts of heat pumps and backup electric boilers. So there's no gas on site, no fossil fuels on site, no flus, no nothing. Um So that obviously transforms the low temperature waste t from the data center boosts that up to the required temperatures. Um And we can obviously higher and lower that then for summer and winter as well. So there's that kind of flexibility. Um And then we take out the gas boilers in the existing buildings and replace them with heat exchangers. So I said one of the advantages for the consumer then as well is you've just got a heat exchanger, you've no gas connection, you have no boiler, you've no carbon monoxide risks. You have no all those safety issues that come with combusting fuels like on site. So I suppose all those buildings now have extra space that they can use. Um And then as soon as you know, it's like build and they will come. So like, I mean, every developer that's looking at doing or building anything around that area now are all asking us when can we connect it to this network? Because the advantages for them are huge. You know, they don't have to invest in any renewables to meet their renewable requirements. They can basically tap into the renewable elements from the District Heating Network. Uh So again, the developer save space and saves money on the, you know, it's just a heat exchange are very, very small. I mean, just take about half a car park space for an apartment block, you know, is the size of the unit requires the kind of heat substation. So no hassle then for them, you know, in terms of supplying heat to, you know, the gas boilers into each, into each apartment, you know, none of those issues. So for them, yeah, we're getting in on requests to know when they can connect.

spk_2: So and the nugget on top that it's nicer to live in a house which is like, you know, sometimes everyone thinks decarbonisation comes at a lifestyle cost. Both of us have lived in homes with district heating. It's a far more enjoyable thing to live with. You have literally 24 7 on demand heating and hot water. So you just pay in the same way that you pay for electricity for whatever you need. Instead of now having to go and turn on an immersion or turn on a boiler because you need some heat, you just turn on the tap and you get hot water and you pay if you use it and you don't, if you don't. And for heating the same.
